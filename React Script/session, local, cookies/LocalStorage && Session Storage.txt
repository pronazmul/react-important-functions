Defination: 	The localStorage and sessionStorage properties allow to save key/value pairs in a web browser. 
		The sessionStorage object stores data for only one session (the data is deleted when the 
		browser tab is closed) On the other hand local storage data will not be deleted when the 
		browser is closed, and will be available the next day, week, or year.

How: 		When the value is single you can pass str, int, bool etc. But when the value is object 
		you must have to {JSON.stringify(obj)} it. When you use this obj {JSON.parse(stirng)} it. 

Set value: 	localStorage/sessionStorage.setItem('id', JSON.stringify(obj))

Get Value: 	localStorage/sessionStorage.getItem('id')

Remove Value: 	localStorage/sessionStorage.removeItem('id');
